  - bugfix: "Luna's energy upgrade is no longer just cosmetic."
  - balance: "To account for some fuckery with ESword balancing, an unupgraded version of Luna has higher unarmored wound chances but even lesser armor penetration and blockchance. The energy upgrade will trade the wound bonus for the stats of an esword."
